# Layout Guidelines

The white-label grid is flexible enough to accomodate various content-based layouts, used to prioritize and emphasize certain pieces of content on a given sitepage. Multiple layouts can be used on one page according to the page template. All Layouts should align with the Hard/Fixed Grid.

Below you can find some examples of component layouts currently in use.


## Examples of Layouts Currently In Use:


### **List Layout**
List layouts are typically a maximum of 12 columns wide on desktop, 8 columns on mobile. This layout type is great when creating a list for any type of content, and can flex to emphasize certain important or "featured" pieces of content.

| Example Name  | Contents | Wireframe |
|--|--|--|
| block List | 4 sm cards | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-1Col-1.jpg" width="100" /> |
| block list with featured block ("block list group 1col with heading block") | 1 lg card, 4 sm cards | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-1Col-2.jpg" width="100" /> |
| block list with multiple featured blocks ("block list group")| 2 lg cards, 4 sm cards | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-1Col-3.jpg" width="100" /> |


### **7 Column Layout (w/ Custom AD Right Rail)**
Not a typical layout, this is used whenever a traditional right-rail is needed to only show ADs. When possible on mobile, 7col layouts will stack left over right.

| Example Name  | Contents | Wireframe |
|--|--|--|
| block list group with ad, block list group with 300x600 ad | 4 sm cards, 1 ad | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-2Col6040-1.jpg" width="200" /> |
| block list group with footer block and ad | 4 sm cards, 1 lg card, 1 ad | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-2Col6040-2.jpg" width="200" /> |

### **4x6 Two Column**
Similar to a card, this layout is used to show a group or piece of content where one element has prominence. This can be used as a promotional unit showcasing an image, button/forms, and text, or can be used to support a more complex card grid. On mobile, 4x6 layouts will stack left over right.

| Example Name  | Contents | Wireframe |
|--|--|--|
| Newsletter Promo ("n/a" - used for email collection on Gothamist Homepage currently) | 1 image, 1 custom text | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-2Col4060-1.jpg" width="200" /> |

### **6x6 Two Column**
This layout is used when two items or groups of items are given equal horizonal weight. On mobile, 6x6 layouts will stack left over right.

| Example Name | Contents | Wireframe |
|--|--|--|
| block group 2up | 2 lg cards | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-2Col5050-1.jpg" width="200" /> |
| Featured Block List | Section Title, 3 sm cards, 1 lg card  | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-2Col5050-2.jpg" width="200" /> |
| Featured Block List Secondary | Section Title, 3 sm cards, 1 lg card, 1 button | <img alt="List" src="/images/Foundations-Layout-2Col5050-3.jpg" width="200" /> |
