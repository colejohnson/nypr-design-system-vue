      <p class="u-space--bottom">Design systems are made up of building blocks that help organizations build scalable, user-centric, data-driven
        products with consistent UX. Our design system, Radial consists of a component library, a living style guide and
        theming tools.</p>
      <p class="u-space--bottom">Radial is the framework that we will use to build, iterate and optimize digital experiences, extend brand
        identity, deliver consistent UI/UX patterns, and optimize process across disciplines. With a design system in
