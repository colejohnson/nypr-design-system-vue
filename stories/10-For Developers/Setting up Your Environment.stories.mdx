# Setting Up your Environment For Local Development

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nypublicradio/nypr-design-system.git
cd nypr-design-system
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

> :warning: NOTE: You may need to install watchman if your dev environment doesn't have it already 

```bash
brew install watchman
``` 

### Start ember
```bash
ember serve
```

(*Storybook looks at the `/dist/` folder to find your ember components. If you're only working on documentation and not modifying ember components, you should be able to get away with only running `ember build`, but if you make any changes to ember code they won't be reflected in storybook until you build again.)

### Run storybook
While ember is still running:
```bash
yarn storybook
```

Storybook will open automatically in your browser. You can now edit your components and stories and see the changes live.
