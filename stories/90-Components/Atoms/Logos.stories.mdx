# Logos

  
## Usage

Logos serve as branding opportunities for our websites, as well as a landmark that helps our users navigate back to the homepage. Per Neilsonâ€™s guidelines for logo placment, users are most likely to find the logos for websites in the upper left corner of the page. This top of page placement fits with default patterns found around the web. 

All logo designs shown here are maintained by our Marketing department. Please reach out to Marketing using the Creative Request Form for any additional sizes or colorways as needed.

## Appearance & Placement

When placing the logo, use the height and width of the first letter as a visual aid for the amount of clear space that should be maintained around the logo. This
will ensure adequate space from competing text and imagery.
