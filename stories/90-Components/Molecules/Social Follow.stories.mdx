# Social Follow

The social follow component is used for linking to the social media
accounts for a site, show, person, etc.

## Default State

The default state takes only a `handle` argument and returns a component that
displays a "Follow Us" label, and three icons linked to their appropriate
networks: Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

**Note:** If handles are different between social networks (e.g. `WNYC` vs.
`WNYCRadio`), please use the *Component Block* version of this component to take
full control over the component's presentation.



## Overriding the "Follow Us" Label

The "Follow Us" label can be overridden (because "us" may not be appropriate
for every use-case) via the `@label` argument:



## Overriding / Re-arranging Social Networks via Component Block

The component can also be used as a higher order component so that you can have
complete control over a) which social networks are displayed, b) what order
they are displayed in, and c) the full URL that they link to.

This format requires you pass the full `@href` attribute into the sub-component in
order for it to correctly link.

**Note**: You *must* use this format if the social media handles differ between
social networks (e.g. if Facebook was "WNYC" while Twitter used lower-case "wnyc").

In the below example, we've moved Twitter to be the *first* social network
displayed, and have removed Instagram entirely
